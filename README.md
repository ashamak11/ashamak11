# Hi there, I'm Asha 👋

I'm a passionate 2nd-year Computer Science student whose journey into coding began during the COVID-19 pandemic 
when a YouTube video sparked my curiosity and transformed my perspective on technology. That initial spark ignited 
a deep interest in exploring the endless possibilities of programming, and ever since, I've been dedicated to learning, 
experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what code can achieve. Whether I'm tackling a complex problem, building 
innovative projects, or collaborating with peers, I embrace every challenge as an opportunity to grow and make a positive 
impact. I’m excited to leverage my skills and enthusiasm to contribute to transformative software engineering projects and 
further hone my craft in an ever-evolving digital landscape.
